Our rich understanding of candidates\u2019 skills and propriety machine learning models enable us to find the right match between our candidates and partner companies. This is why companies like Apple, Dropbox and American Express trust Triplebyte\u2019s technical assessment to identify the best engineers for their open roles and reduce the time and effort it takes to hire them.We just raised a $35 million Series B and our team of 65 is growing quickly!

Our rich understanding of candidates\u2019 skills and propriety machine learning models enable us to find the right match between our candidates and partner companies.
